Here are some tips:
- Say "Investigate" to revisit peaces of mystery you already unlock. Pay attention to the places and people mentioned in them.

- Unlock new pieces of mystery by investigating new people or locations. For example, you could say "Find Jasper Meeks" to meet with Sir Jasper Meeks.

- Ask the game to read the newspaper for extra clues. 

- Use deduction to figure the mystery. Esteblish timeline, check alibies try to esteblish who is lying and who is telling the truth.  Discuss it with your playing group. 

- Ask the game to "Finish the case" when you think you've investigated enough or if you just want to hear the solution.

- If you leave the game you can comeback by asking assitant "Talk to Sherlock Mysteries". You will continue from where you left off.
