		    <ul>
		     <li>Say "Talk to Sherlock Mysteries" to Google Assistant to start playing.</li>
		     <li>Listen to or read pieces of the story you've already unlocked. Pay attention to the places and people mentioned in them.</li>
		     <li>Figure out the next place or person to investigate and ask the game to search for it. For example, say "Find Jasper Meeks" to look for Jasper Meeks.</li>
		     <li>Read the newspaper for extra clues. You can ask the game to read it or read it in <a href="./clues">Clues section</a>.</li>
		     <li>Use deduction to figure out who commited the crime, and how the person did it.</li>
		     <li>Ask the game to finish the case when you think you've investigated enough or just want to know case solution.</li>
		     <li>Sherlock Mysteries can be played as a cooperative game by listening to the game stories and deciding where to go together. You can share this link with your group.</li>
